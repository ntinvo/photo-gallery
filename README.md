#### Notes:
* *I decided to create the PhotoGallery as a carousel because I like pictures to be full screen.*

## Improvements ü§î
* Right now, for the sake of simplicity, I put the data in `photo-gallery/src/data/data.js`. For improvement, I can create a server with some APIs that can handle requests so that the users can `add/edit/remove` images.
* From the main app, the user can have a setting button, that can display photos as a grid/list/fullscreen. 
* Autoplay: From the setting, the user can have something like a checkbox that will enable autoplay of the photos in the gallery.
* I can add the dots in the slide show to indicate the indices of the photos.
* Improve the UI on mobile devices: even though I have added the media queries, but there are some small things that can be improved on small devices.
* Improve the caption with different font, font-size,...
